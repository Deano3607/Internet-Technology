		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			Building a PC initially seems like a very daunting task. You need to find out what parts to buy, what is compatible with what, where to buy from, how to assemble them together, etc., etc. It all becomes too much pretty quickly.
		</p>
				
		<h2>What is a PC?</h2>
		<p>
			A PC is made up of several different components, each being a crucial part in the working of the final machine.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Power Supply Unit</h4>
		<p>
			A power supply unit (PSU) converts mains AC to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a computer. Modern personal computers universally use a switched-mode power supply.
			<br>
			PSUs will be rated for different power levels, you must select one with a high enough wattage to be able to power your entire computer system.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Motherboard</h4>
		<p>
			A motherboard is the printed circuit board containing the principal components of a computer or other device, with connectors for other circuit boards to be slotted into.

		<h4>Central Processing Unit</h4>
		<p>
			The central processing unit, also known as "CPU", is usually the main powerhouse of computer. It is easy to compare to the brain of a human, all the signals travel through the CPU to be handled depending on what needs to be done.

		<h4>Memory</h4>
		<p>Random Access Memory, commonly referred to as "RAM" or just "Memory" is where data is stored whilst it is being accessed by the CPU. It is incredibly fast access that allows the CPU to work on the data without waiting; if the CPU had to access the hard disk for everything, the computer would be limited to the data transfer speed of the disk (usually around 85MB/sec).
		
		<h4>Storage</h4>
		<p>
			<!--
			Talk about SSD, HDD, SSHD/Hybrid drives

		</p>
		
		<h4>Case</h4>
		<p>
			<!--
			Talk about what a case is, different form factors, sizes, fans, etc.
